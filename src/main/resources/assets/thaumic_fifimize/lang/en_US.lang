thaumic_fifimize.research_page.SEAL_COPIER.0=I have created plans for a basic seal copying device. I just need to configure one seal with the settings I need, then right click it with the copier. I then only need to right click every other seal I want to apply the settings to. If I want to clear the memory of the copier, I need to right click while sneaking. I can then copy new settings and continue.<BR>It seems that the seal copier is unable to interact with seals that were not placed by the owner. I should keep this in mind if I am working with other Thaumaturges.
